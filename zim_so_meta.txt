====== zim so meta ======
Created Sonntag 06 JÃ¤nner 2013

What a neat little piece of software. This section helps me with the use of zim.

====== GIT ======

With Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins I find my plugins. By default the Version Control Plugin is enabled. I then can choose under prefernces that changes should be saved automatically from time to time. I can't remember if this was enabled by default. Nevertheless changes are automatically commited, but not pushed.

[ ] Think of something clever, to get the pushing automatically done.

===== Privacy =====

This appears to be so useful, that I might be tempted to use it for personal data in the near future. This hower can not be done using a public repository. How will I solve this, will I use 2 different zim, or will I just use a private one? There are 3 different modes I can think of

1. All Private - 
	+ no privacy issues
	- more difficult to access
	- no quick sharing with others
	- no webpublishing 
2. Two Wikis
	+ private
	+ and public
	- might be more difficult to maintain (more overhead)
3. Only Public.
	+ good for sharing
	+ web publishing
	+ easy access
	- can't use for personal organisation
